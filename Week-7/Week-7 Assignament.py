# Question 1: How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
    # 1. Formulating null and alternative hypotheses
    # 2. Choosing a significance level (typically α = 0.05)
    # 3. Calculating the test statistic and p-value
    # 4. Comparing p-value to significance level
    # 5. Making a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis
    # If p < α, we reject the null hypothesis.


# Question 2: What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
    # The Central Limit Theorem states that when you take sufficiently large random samples from any population (with finite variance), 
    # the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.

    # Key points:
    #     Sample size should typically be ≥ 30
    #     The mean of sampling distribution equals population mean
    #     Standard error = population standard deviation / √n
    #     As sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more normal
    # Importance:
    #     Enables statistical inference and hypothesis testing
    #     Allows us to use normal distribution properties for analysis
    #     Forms the foundation for confidence intervals
    #     Makes it possible to estimate population parameters from samples


# Question 3: What is the statistical power?
    # Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.


# Question 4: How do you control for biases?
    # Bias in research refers to systematic errors that can distort the results and conclusions 
    # of a study. Controlling for biases ensures more accurate and reliable outcomes.
    
    # Ways to Control for Biases:
    #   Randomization: Randomly assigning subjects to groups
    #   Blinding: Preventing participants/researchers from knowing group assignments
    #   Stratification: Ensuring balanced representation across subgroups
    #   Using control groups
    #   Cross-validation
    #   Representative sampling
    #   Standardized procedures
    

# Question 5: What are confounding variables?
    # A confounding variable is an external variable that influences both the independent variable (cause) 
    # and the dependent variable (effect) in a study.


# Question 6: What is A/B testing?
    # A/B testing is an experimental method used to compare two variants (A and B) to determine which performs 
    # better with respect to a defined metric.


# Question 7: What are confidence intervals?
    # A confidence interval is a range of values that estimates a population parameter (e.g., mean or proportion) 
    # with a specified level of confidence. It provides a measure of uncertainty or reliability about the estimate.
